				Web design and development have evolved so much in the last 20 years. I mean, just look at Apple is
				old website.

				Just look at how far we have come with design in the past decade.

				It takes a team of people to launch a polished website, and I am going to talk about two important
				roles in that team: Web designers and developers.

				While designers and developers often work together, they generally do different tasks to get a
				website online. It is possible someone can be a designer and a developer at the same time, but
				generally, these are two different roles.

				Web analytics is the measurement and analysis of data to inform an understanding of user behavior
				across web pages.

				Analytics platforms measure activity and behavior on a website, for example: how many users visit,
				how long they stay, how many pages they visit, which pages they visit, and whether they arrive by
				following a link or not.

				Businesses use web analytics platforms to measure and benchmark site performance and to look at key
				performance indicators that drive their business, such as purchase conversion rate.

				Digital marketing, also called online marketing, is the promotion of brands to connect with
				potential customers using the internet and other forms of digital communication. This includes not
				only email, social media, and web-based advertising, but also text and multimedia messages as a
				marketing channel.

				Essentially, if a marketing campaign involves digital communication, it's digital marketing.

				Digital marketing and inbound marketing are easily confused, and for good reason. Digital marketing
				uses many of the same tools as inbound marketingâ€”email and online content, to name a few. Both exist
				to capture the attention of prospects through the buyer is journey and turn them into customers. But
				the 2 approaches take different views of the relationship between the tool and the goal
